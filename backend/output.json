During   the   Cold   War ,   Austria   was   the easternmost   'Western' democracy , bordered by Warsaw Pact states. Along with neutral Switzerland, it formed a geopolitical buffer   between   NATO   and   the   Eastern   bloc .   After   1990,   the   collapse   of   communist   regimes transformed Austria's neighborhood - communist neighbors became democracies, Yugoslavia split, and Germany reunified .   Austria   joined   the   EU   in   1995   as   part   of   a 'Westernization' process , shedding its Cold War role as a bridge and fully integrating into Western Europe . -Population & Demographics: German is the dominant language , spoken as a mother tongue by >90% of inhabitants . Traditional linguistic minorities (e.g. ~20k Croats in Burgenland, ~20k Slovenes in Carinthia) persist but are small . Austria was historically a Catholic-majority society: ~78% Catholic in 1991 (down from 89% in 1951) with minorities of ~5% Protestants, 2% Muslims, 0.1% Jewish .   The   decline   in   Catholic   share   (and   rise   of   nonreligious   and   Muslim   populations)   reflects post-1950s secularization and immigration . Austria remains religiously homogeneous compared to many countries, but Catholic dominance has waned over time . -Migration: Foreign immigration surged after the late 1980s. By 1995 about 10% of residents (713,500 people) were foreign nationals . The number of non-citizens more than doubled from ~291,000 in 1981 to over 700,000 in 1994 . This influx stemmed from the turmoil of Eastern Europe's opening and the Yugoslav wars, as Austria's prosperity and border location attracted Central/East European migrants .   The   new   immigrant   communities   introduced   more   diversity   (e.g.   a   growing   Muslim 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 12 13 12 14 15 16"

After 1918 , the new Republic of Austria struggled with its identity - many Austrians saw themselves as 'Germans' and the rump state as unviable . Indeed, the First Republic initially called itself the 'German-Austrian Republic' and sought union ( Anschluss ) with Germany. This panGerman sentiment was strong across the political spectrum; even the Social Democrats only abandoned the Anschluss idea in 1933 when Nazi influence grew .   In 1938 ,   Austria   was   annexed   by   Nazi Germany with significant local support, demonstrating that a distinct Austrian national identity was weak before World War II. After 1945 , however, the Second Republic cultivated a new identity separate from Germany. The Allied powers, via the 1943 Moscow Declaration, defined Austria as 'the first victim of Hitlerite aggression' - a narrative eagerly embraced by Austrian leaders to portray Austria as a victim rather than a perpetrator of Nazism . This 'victim theory' allowed postwar Austrians to evade   deep   confrontation   with   their   Nazi-era   culpability .   Both   major   parties   (Socialists   and conservatives) tacitly agreed to avoid divisive discussions of wartime guilt, instead emphasizing antiNazi   resistance   and   suffering .   Over   time,   this   helped   solidify   an Austrian   national consciousness distinct   from   German   identity.   Surveys   reflect   this   shift:   in   1964   only   47%   agreed 'Austrians are a nation,' but by 1990 around 74% did - evidence that Austrians came to overwhelmingly see themselves as a separate nation . 17 18 18 19 20 21 20 22 23"

International critics pointed out   that,   unlike   Germany,   Austria   had   'escaped   responsibility'   for   Nazism .   The   Waldheim controversy catalyzed intense debates about Austrian complicity in Nazi crimes and stirred latent antiSemitism in Austrian society (some Waldheim defenders portrayed him as a 'victim' of an international Jewish campaign, prompting a new wave of anti-Jewish sentiment) . This episode forced Austria to finally confront historical truths that had been suppressed. By the 1990s, Austria's self-image became more self-critical and internationally Austria lost some of its 'special' status. As Pelinka notes, joining the EU in 1995 and rethinking neutrality made Austria appear more 'normal' - 'a small, rather ordinary country on the eastern fringes of Western Europe' . In sum, by the end of the 20th century Austria had emerged from the shadow of its imperial and Nazi past with a consolidated national identity and a status as a mainstream Western democracy, though one still grappling with the legacy of its darker history. 24 21 25 26 27 28"

      "text": "-Consociational Democracy in Austria: After 1945, Austria established a consociational democracy -a power-sharing system designed to stabilize a deeply divided society . This was not a theoretical plan but a pragmatic elite response to the traumatic conflicts of the interwar years . The two major political camps from the First Republic - the Socialists (later SPÖ) and Catholic Conservatives (ÖVP) -set   aside   their   'lager'   (camp)   hostilities   and   entered grand coalitions ,   cooperating   rather   than competing to rebuild the nation .   Key features of Austrian consociationalism included: grand coalition governments at federal and often state levels (SPÖ and ÖVP sharing power), proportional allocation   of   public   positions   and   resources   (known   as Proporz ),   a 'party   state' where   parties permeated all aspects of society, and corporatist interest-group integration ('social partnership') in policymaking .   This   system   intentionally bridged historic cleavages - e.g. between secular Socialists and Catholic Conservatives, and even included rehabilitating former Nazis. Both SPÖ and ÖVP sought to recruit ex-Nazi supporters in the 1940s-50s, effectively re-integrating many 'misguided' Austrians into democratic politics rather than excluding them .   By   accommodating all major social groups, consociational democracy 'healed wounds' of the past and fostered a broad consensus on   the new  Austrian   nation   and   democracy .   Crucially,   this elite   cooperation helped transform old identities: Austrians who once identified primarily with a religious or ideological camp gradually developed loyalty to the Austrian state. As Pelinka observes, national unity in the Second Republic was built via consociational techniques ,   which   created   an   inclusive   sense   of   Austrian nationhood that transcended the previous supranational (Habsburg) and pan-German visions . Consociationalism was thus both a political arrangement and a nation-building tool in postwar Austria. -The 'Party State' and Corporatism: Austria became a 'party-state developed to the extreme,' with political   parties   dominating   society   and   even   merging   with   state   institutions .   During   the   first decades, nearly all important positions in politics and public life were apportioned between the two major parties . In the 1960s-70s, SPÖ and ÖVP together regularly won over 90% of the vote - an unparalleled concentration of power in Western Europe . Party membership was massive (up to 30% of adults in the 1970s belonged to a party) , and each party presided over a vast network of affiliate organizations (unions, business federations, youth clubs, sports leagues, media outlets, etc.). This pillarized subculture system meant Austrians were often born into either the 'red' (Socialist) or 'black' (Catholic) camp and remained loyal for life . At the same time, interest group corporatism was institutionalized: peak associations of labor , business, and farmers were formally integrated into policy drafting. Through the Paritätische Kommission ( Joint Commission on Wages and Prices) and other bodies, unions and employer groups coordinated with the government to set economic policy, wages, and social reforms. This 'social partnership' ensured labor peace (virtually no strikes) and 29 30 31 32 32 33 22 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45"

Pelinka notes that consociational democracy had 'reached its goal' - it stabilized Austria - and thereafter its necessity came into question . One major change was the decline of lifelong party loyalty and subcultural milieus . After about 100 years of political camps reproducing themselves, the chain was breaking: younger generations no longer automatically inherited the party allegiance of their parents . By the 1990s, Austria's electorate had split along generational lines. Older Austrians largely remained in a two-and-a-half party world (SPÖ, ÖVP, with FPÖ as a minor third), whereas younger voters experienced a competitive five-party system - with FPÖ and the Greens rising and the ÖVP often lagging among youth .   This generation gap signified the end of the old camps: people were no longer simply 'red' or 'black' by birth. In the mid-1990s, political attitudes were sharply split between those with 'traditional loyalties' to   SPÖ/ÖVP   and   a   new   cohort   of volatile   voters drawn to insurgent parties .   The   social institutions that once bound individuals to a camp (party-affiliated schools, youth groups, churches, unions, etc.) lost influence. For example, the Catholic Church's role in socializing conservative voters waned, and union membership among youth declined. Voter dealignment was evidenced by a drop in electoral turnout (from ~93% in 1975 to ~82% in 1994) and a rise in late-deciding, swing voters . All these trends point to a more individualized, issue-oriented political culture . -Rise of New Parties and Cleavages: The weakening of the SPÖ-ÖVP duopoly opened space for new 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57"

More disruptively, the Freedom Party (FPÖ) , once a minor liberalnationalist   party,   transformed   under Jörg   Haider into   a   right-wing populist   force .   Haider's inflammatory mix of anti-establishment rhetoric and anti-immigrant themes resonated with many working-class and young voters disillusioned by the grand coalition. The FPÖ's vote share leapt from 5% in 1983 to over 20% in the mid-1990s ,   making it the second-largest party by 1999 .   However , unlike the traditional 'third camp' (German-nationalist) which had been marginalized in the 1950s-60s, Haider's FPÖ managed to mainstream much of the far-right sentiment by packaging it as broad populism rather than explicit neo-Nazism .   This   development introduced a new cleavage in Austrian politics: a liberal-cosmopolitan vs. nationalist-populist divide. Whereas old politics split chiefly on class and religion, the emerging divides centered on values and identity - for example, integration   with   Europe   vs.   defending   sovereignty ,   or multicultural   openness   vs.   nativist backlash . The FPÖ mobilized grievances against immigration and the 'political elites,' capitalizing on issues outside the consensus style of politics (e.g. a 1993 FPÖ-sponsored anti-foreigner referendum campaign garnered 7% of voters' signatures) . In summary, by the 1990s Austrian political culture was in transition: consensual habits persisted , but they were increasingly challenged by polarization and pluralization . The grand coalition model still governed, yet underneath was a more fragmented electorate with new players and issues, presaging a more 'normal' Western European party system after decades of exceptional stability . 58 59 60 61 62 49 63"

This   flexibility   allowed   pragmatic adaptation over time (Austria added many 'constitutional laws' on specific matters).

The Bundesrat   (Federal   Council) is   an   upper   house representing the states ( Länder ), but it wields only a suspensive veto and is often considered a mere 'appendage' .

Ministries   are   often   divided   between   coalition partners ( Proporz principle). Because Austria lacked alternation of power for long periods (SPÖ and ÖVP often governed together or swapped in coalitions), the traditional government-opposition dynamic was muted. Instead, governance was characterized by inter-party negotiation and 'behind closed doors' policy formulation (often involving interest groups). Still, the formal mechanisms of parliamentary democracy exist: the Nationalrat can pass no-confidence votes , committees can scrutinize bills, etc. It's worth noting that since the 1980s the parliament has become more assertive as coalition discipline loosened - the 1990s Nationalrat was 'more dynamic than ever' , with more parties and less strict voting along party lines .

However ,   Austrian federalism is relatively centralized . The federal constitution distributes legislative competencies, but most key areas (e.g. criminal law, civil law, finance, social security, education standards) are federally legislated. States have primary lawmaking power mainly in local matters (e.g. zoning, nature protection, youth laws) and execute many federal laws under a system of indirect federal administration (state authorities   implement   federal   laws).   Each   Land   has   an   elected   legislature   ( Landtag )   and   a   state government headed by a Governor (Landeshauptmann) .   Uniquely, many states historically formed 'proportional governments' : by state constitutional provisions, all parties above a certain vote share received seats in the state's executive cabinet, rather than the cabinet being formed by only the majority party .   This   was   a   continuation   of   consociational  practice at the subnational level, ensuring broad coalition governance and virtually no opposition. By the 1990s, this practice came under criticism - as party competition increased and more parties entered Landtage, proportional cabinets were seen as stifling   proper   opposition   and   accountability .   Several   states   (Tyrol,   Salzburg,   Upper Austria, Styria) began reconsidering or reforming this system in the late 1990s . Indeed, as SPÖ/ÖVP dominance declines, the smaller parties (FPÖ, Greens) sometimes find themselves co-opted into state governments by default, raising the question of whether a genuine opposition is being 'avoided' . There is a trend toward more majority-based rule in the Länder , mirroring national changes. -Local Government: Below the Land level, Austria is divided into districts and municipalities.

Municipalities ( Gemeinden ), however, do have elected councils and mayors. Austria has thousands of municipalities (from small villages to cities). Historically, some municipalities (especially in mixed-language areas or under consociational norms) also followed proportional representation in their councils. A significant reform in the 1990s was the introduction of direct election of mayors in most states . This increased direct accountability at the local level and is seen as a move toward more populist, personalized local politics ,   breaking   with   the   old   party   patronage   system   where mayors were chosen by council coalitions. For example, citizens in most Länder now vote for mayoral candidates directly, which can result in split-ticket outcomes (a mayor from one party and council majority from another) - a novelty in Austrian local governance that enhances voter choice and potentially   local   political   competition.   Overall,   while   Austria's   formal   structure   remains   federal,   in practice strong central institutions and a tradition of cross-party power-sharing long kept regional autonomy and local politics subdued.

For example, in 1949 the two won 82.7% while the precursor to FPÖ (Verband der Unabhängigen) managed 11.7% . In the 1970s , SPÖ under Bruno Kreisky even governed alone after 1971, reflecting its high popularity (SPÖ peaked at 51% in 1979).

By 1990 , their combined vote fell to ~79%, and in 1994 to just ~63%. This trend is attributed to factors noted earlier: voter dealignment, emergence of the Greens and Haider's FPÖ, and issues that cut across traditional class/religion lines. The electoral system -proportional representation with a modest threshold (4%) - facilitated multiparty representation as soon as voters shifted preferences. The establishment of a 4% threshold in 1994 slightly checked fragmentation, but as seen, FPÖ and Greens had already secured their spots. Voter turnout , once extremely high under the old mobilization structures (e.g. 95% in 1950s elections), declined into the 80% range by the 1990s , indicating a less mobilized base.

The Church wielded influence over education, social services, and voters'   loyalties   (priests   openly   instructed   congregants   on   voting).   After   1945,   the   Church   initially retained a privileged status through the reinstated 1933 Concordat (treaty with the Vatican). Catholic interests were formally integrated into the political system - for example, the state continued to fund religious   education   and   collect church taxes on behalf of recognized denominations. This  close church-state partnership (a legacy of Emperor Joseph II's Josephinism ) ensured that Austria did not experience a harsh separation of church and state as France did; instead, a 'quasi-corporatist' relationship developed, treating the Church as an official voice in public affairs. This arrangement stabilized politics by avoiding kulturkampf conflicts: controversial issues like divorce or abortion were handled via compromise, preventing the fierce ideological battles that occurred in the 1920s and 1930s . However, by the late 20th century, secularization and internal Church changes weakened Catholic cohesion. Church attendance and influence fell sharply - younger Austrians became less religious, and the Church largely withdrew from partisan politics ,   focusing on its spiritual role. The traditionally Catholic   ÖVP   broadened   its   appeal   beyond   the   pulpit.   In   the   1980s-90s,   the   Church   faced   new challenges: progressive   Catholics sought reforms (e.g. ending celibacy,  greater   role   for   laity).   This culminated in 1995's 'Church Referendum' (Kirchenvolks-Begehren) - a petition signed by over 500,000 Austrian Catholics calling for liberalizing church policies. While an internal church matter , its popularity showed that Austrian Catholics were no longer a monolithic bloc obedient to the hierarchy. Furthermore, high-profile controversies (e.g. abuse scandals or the 1995 resignation of Cardinal Groër) eroded trust. Thus, the once-dominant 'Catholic subculture' - with its dense network of clubs, media (like diocesan newspapers), and voter guides - largely dissipated .   Austrians  of  Catholic background became politically diverse: many still vote ÖVP, but others support SPÖ, Greens, or FPÖ based on issues rather than religious identity. Pluralism within Catholicism grew, and the Church's official voice became just one interest among many in policymaking . In short, by the 1990s Austria was effectively a secular democracy , where Catholicism remained culturally significant but no longer dictated political alignments or state policy as it once did. 103 104"

In the early 20th century, 'Red Vienna'   and   workers'   organizations   built   a   vibrant   socialist   counter-society   -   with   party-affiliated housing, sports clubs, newspapers, and even literacy programs - which gave workers a strong class identity. After World War II, the SPÖ moderated its ideology (dropping Marxist references in 1958) and fully committed to parliamentary democracy and the mixed economy. In government, especially under Chancellor Bruno Kreisky (1970-83) , the SPÖ pursued pragmatic reforms and expanded the welfare state. This led to broad appeal beyond its blue-collar base - for a time, the SPÖ became the natural party of government, attracting professionals and youth as well. However, the traditional socialist milieu eroded over time due to rising prosperity, educational expansion, and the dilution of class consciousness. Trade union membership , while still high (Austria's unionization remained above EU average),   no   longer   translated   automatically   into   SPÖ   votes   or   activism.   Many   union   members supported the ÖVP or FPÖ by the 1990s, driven by non-economic issues. The workers' loyalty that once passed down generations ('my grandfather was a Socialist, my father was a Socialist…') weakened - as noted, younger working-class Austrians increasingly shifted to the FPÖ's populist appeal in the 1990s . For example, the SPÖ's share of the manual labor vote fell significantly as the FPÖ gained among that demographic . Organizationally, the SPÖ saw its party membership in decline (especially after the 1980s) .   In   Vienna   -   once   the   heart   of   socialist   subculture  -  SPÖ  membership and the density of party-linked social clubs dropped compared to the First Republic era . Even the SPÖ's May Day rallies, though still held (Vienna SPÖ famously continues to celebrate May 1st in grand style ), have lost the mass mobilizational character they had in earlier decades.

This was Austria's version of the 'Third Way' trend in European social democracy. However, such moves sometimes alienated   the   party's   traditional   left   wing   and   labor   union   activists.   The   loss   of   a   clear   socialist ideological profile may have indirectly fueled voter drift to protest parties. Still, the SPÖ remained one of Austria's two pillar parties , and indeed by the 1990s it had spent more time in government than almost any other social democratic party in Europe. Pelinka points out that Austrian social democracy stayed in power (usually via coalitions) through the 1980s-90s even as it shed its subcultural armor . This prolonged incumbency without a strong subculture perhaps contributed to voter fatigue and the search for 'new' politics among some citizens. Summarily, the Red subculture's farewell meant that being a Social Democrat in Austria no longer meant a cradle-to-grave immersion in party structures; it became a matter of policy preference, while lifestyle and social identity ceased to revolve solely around the party."

      "text": "-'Economic Miracle': Starting from the rubble of 1945, Austria engineered a remarkable economic recovery. At war's end, the country was devastated - industrial output had collapsed and infrastructure was ruined. With aid from the Marshall Plan (from 1948) and prudent policies, Austria's economy rebounded strongly by the 1950s. GDP growth was high, unemployment low, and Austria rapidly transitioned from a poor, agrarian economy to an urbanized, industrialized one. By 1980 , Austria joined the ranks of wealthy nations. In fact, by 1994 it was the world's 8th richest country in per capita GDP (around $25,000), surpassing even some EU partners like the UK or Italy. This affluence allowed Austria in 1995 to become a net contributor to the EU budget -   a   point   of   pride   that   underscored   its transformation from aid recipient to donor. The 'economic miracle' was underpinned by Austria's unique social model: strong social partnership and corporatism kept industrial peace and wage inflation in check, while the state guided development through indicative planning and ownership of key sectors. Nationalized Industries: After WWII, the government (under coalition consensus) took majority ownership of crucial industries (steel, petrochemicals, mining) and banks. This was partly to prevent   Soviet   seizure   of   German-owned   assets   and   partly   to   ensure   national   control   over   the commanding heights of the economy. These nationalized industries , alongside a burgeoning private sector,   powered exports and job growth in the 50s-60s. The state sector also allowed successive governments (often SPÖ-led) to pursue near full employment by acting anti-cyclically - e.g., Kreisky's government in the 1970s deliberately ran deficits to stave off unemployment during the oil shocks , a policy that was feasible due to state influence in the economy. Austria thus avoided the high unemployment that many Western countries suffered in the 1970s; its unemployment rate remained among Europe's lowest. Another success factor was tourism - Austria's Alps and culture made it a top tourist destination, consistently earning a surplus in its tourism balance (Table 6.5 shows tourism brought in net revenues annually). By the 1980s, Austria also benefited from being a stable haven for investment, attracting some foreign capital and technology (though before EU entry, it limited foreign ownership in strategic sectors). In summary, high growth, low inequality, and a robust welfare state defined Austria's postwar economic success, often touted as the 'Austrian model.' Pelinka notes that Austria's experience disproved early skeptics who thought the small republic couldn't be viable without its empire - on the contrary, it thrived as an independent social market economy . 107 108"

However , historically Austria often trailed the core of Western Europe in industrialization - Pelinka refers to a 'delay factor' : Western Europe's economic trends would reach Austria later, causing a persistent developmental lag. For example, Austria's industrial take-off happened more in the 1950s, whereas Germany's was already earlier . Nonetheless, being on the 'fringe of the European prosperity zone' had advantages: by the 1980s, Austria served as a bridge for West European firms expanding eastward, and Viennese banks became key players in new Eastern markets. Regionally, western Austria (Tyrol, Vorarlberg) historically enjoyed closer ties to Switzerland/Germany and often had higher incomes and more innovation, whereas southern/eastern Austria (Styria, Burgenland) had to overcome the loss of former imperial markets and the proximity to poorer communist ·"

For decades, nationalized firms had guaranteed jobs and social benefits, sometimes at the cost of efficiency.   By   1985,   as   steel   demand   slumped   and   competition intensified, these firms required massive state bailouts. It 'became obvious that Austria was economically more dependent than [many realized]' - i.e. not immune to global currents. The government   (a   SPÖ-ÖVP   coalition   under   Chancellor   Franz   Vranitzky)   launched   painful restructuring: thousands of steelworkers were laid off (a shock in a country used to near-full employment), unprofitable units were shut, and a wave of privatization began. Over the late 80s and 90s, Austria privatized banks, steel plants, petrochemical firms, and airlines. This was partially ideologically driven (a shift toward market liberalism in line with EU trends) and partially forced by EU competition rules (state subsidies had to be curtailed upon EU entry). The 'end of Austro-keynesianism' meant the government could no longer guarantee jobs  for  life   in national industries. While necessary, these changes increased workers' feelings of insecurity and, politically, some of that discontent channeled into the FPÖ's appeal to those yearning for the old guarantees.

Influenced by Catholic social doctrine (which sought to harmonize classes as 'organism' rather than allow socialist class struggle or unfettered capitalism) , post-1945 leaders from both the Socialist and Conservative camps deliberately constructed a 'culture of cooperation' between organized labor and business. Early steps included the creation of the Joint Commission   on   Wages   and   Prices   (Paritätische   Kommission) in   1957   and   earlier   informal agreements. This institutionalized regular negotiation on economic policy between the government, the ÖGB  (union   federation) ,   and   the business   representatives (Chamber   of   Commerce   and Industrialists' Association), often behind closed doors. The corporatist approach was facilitated by a small number of key figures who straddled party and interest-group roles - e.g. ÖVP Chancellor Julius Raab had been president of the Federal Economic Chamber before leading the government, and Socialist   leaders   like Bruno Pittermann or Benya rose from union ranks. This 'elite continuity' ensured that the party in power and the social partner heads were often from the same networks, making consensus easier. By combining the 'party state' with a 'corporate state,' Austria solved two problems at once: it integrated former ideological enemies and it kept both capital and labor invested in the new democracy. 109"

Austria enjoyed decades of labor peace - the last significant political general strike was in 1950, and it failed largely because social partnership was already taking root, offering a more effective path for workers' interests. Wages grew in line with productivity, avoiding runaway inflation. Austria's inflation   and   unemployment   stayed   lower   than   many   European   peers,   a   fact   often   credited   to coordinated wage bargaining and joint crisis management by unions and employers. For example, during the 1970s oil crisis , the government, ÖGB, and business struck agreements to moderate wage demands in exchange for government measures to control prices, thereby preventing a wage-price spiral. Social cohesion was another benefit - employees felt their voices were heard at the highest level,   reducing   resentment.   Pelinka   suggests   that   corporatism   also buttressed Austrian national identity : by solving class conflict, it removed one of the threats to the new Second Republic's unity, allowing Austrians to feel more 'we're all in the same boat' as a nation .

Environmentalists, for instance, found the growth-oriented consensus ( 'Mehrheitsfähigkeit' ) frustrating, as social partnership tended to prioritize economic expansion and jobs over ecological concerns. Feminists noted that corporatist bodies were dominated by older men, marginalizing women's priorities (though later unions and chambers began including more women). There was also the matter of accountability : if an average citizen disagreed with a corporatist compromise, there was no direct way to change it, since it was forged outside the electoral arena. Nonetheless, surveys in the 1980s showed Austrians were actually proud of their social partnership system - it was often cited as something that set Austria apart positively.

Even the right-populist FPÖ, when it entered government in 2000 (after Pelinka's book), initially left the social partnership largely intact (though with some conflicts).

In sum, Austria in the 1990s was saying goodbye to the era when corporatism defined everything (the era of Raab and Benya forging deals in smoke-filled rooms), but it was not rejecting the idea of consensus . The challenge ahead was to make that consensus more transparent, inclusive, and compatible with a pluralist democracy and EU membership - essentially, to reinvent corporatism for a new age rather than abolish it."

In   April   1955,   in   the Moscow Memorandum ,   Austria   pledged   to   become permanently neutral 'of its own accord' following the model of Switzerland .   Subsequently, on October 26, 1955 , the newly sovereign Austrian parliament passed the Neutrality Act , a constitutional law declaring Austria's everlasting neutrality. This declaration was unilateral but was implicitly accepted by the world powers as part of the State Treaty context. Key features of Austrian neutrality as officially defined: (1) Austria would not join any military alliances and would not permit foreign military bases on its soil; (2) neutrality is perpetual (not just during a specific conflict) ; (3) it is armed neutrality -Austria maintains its own armed forces to defend its neutral status. The United States insisted on Austria having a credible defense capability as a condition for accepting neutrality (to avoid it becoming a defenseless vacuum). From the start, neutrality was understood as militarily but not ideologically neutral - Austria clearly belonged to Western democratic values, though it stayed out of NATO. This nuance allowed Austria to integrate economically with the West (it joined GATT, later EFTA) while maintaining a stance of not participating in military blocs. 111"

It was seen as the guarantor of Austrian independence (especially given memories of being drawn into Hitler's wars) and as a tool that allowed Austria to play an outsized international role as a bridge between East and West . Vienna positioned itself as a venue for East-West dialogue - exemplified by high-profile summits (Kennedy-Khrushchev 1961), the location of important international organizations (UN agencies, OPEC, later the OSCE), and Austria's active UN peacekeeping participation (Austrian troops served in missions in places like Cyprus and the Golan Heights). Domestically, all major parties embraced neutrality. It was often termed 'Austria's Third Way' in foreign policy - neither West nor East, but a small state promoting peace. Neutrality also had broad public support: it was taught in schools as a core principle and celebrated on October 26 (now Austria's national day, commemorating neutrality's adoption). Indeed, by the 1980s over 90% of Austrians consistently favored maintaining neutrality in   opinion   polls.   The   policy   insulated   Austria   from   Cold   War   entanglements  and buttressed the narrative of Austria as 'Hitler's first victim' - i.e. Austrians liked to think their neutrality underscored their difference from Germany and their commitment to peace . · 20"

Austria   was   now   surrounded   by   democracies   and   no   direct   threat   loomed.   This   prompted   a fundamental debate: Should Austria remain neutral in a unifying Europe? Many argued that neutrality had outlived its usefulness and was incompatible with deeper EU integration. Others felt it was still a core part of Austrian identity and useful in a world of new uncertainties. Notably, public opinion remained pro-neutrality even after 1990, though support dipped slightly. For instance, in 1995, polls showed a majority still against NATO membership, but some younger and conservative Austrians began to reconsider alliance options. The grand coalition itself was split: the ÖVP was more open to dropping neutrality and joining NATO, while the SPÖ was more cautious, reflecting its base's attachment to neutrality (and fear of military spending increases)."

It   was   crucial for regaining independence in 1955 and gave Austria a distinct international role during the Cold War . But with the Cold War over and Austria firmly embedded in the European Union, neutrality became somewhat of an anachronism - or at least a flexible concept. By the mid-90s, Austria was 'no longer insisting on its special status' and had assumed a foreign policy profile 'normal in the sense of average West European' .   The   phrase 'farewell to neutrality' reflects that Austria's strategic outlook had shifted from carving a unique path to contributing to collective Western efforts (short of NATO). However, neutrality remained emotionally significant to many Austrians, symbolizing independence and peace. Thus, Austria's approach was to quietly dilute neutrality without revoking it - e.g., participating in EU security cooperation, hosting sanctions meetings, etc., all while officially stating 'we are neutral.' The ultimate fate of neutrality was left open-ended; as of 1998 it was still intact legally, but practically on the way out if Europe's integration continued. In summary, Austria was saying goodbye to the strict neutrality of 1955, moving toward a security policy compatible with Western partnerships, yet it tried to do so without alienating a public for whom neutrality was part of national identity. This careful balance is a defining element of Austria's foreign policy at the century's end. 28"

For decades, Austria downplayed its role in Nazi crimes, clinging to the victim narrative (that it was annexed by force in 1938). Chapter 9 delves   into   the   historical   reality   that   many   Austrians   were   not   just   victims   but enthusiastic participants in Nazism. In 1938, the Anschluss (union with Germany) was greeted by large jubilant crowds in Vienna. Austrians joined the Nazi party (NSDAP) in droves - about 700,000 Austrians (8% of the population) were NSDAP members , roughly the same proportion as in Germany. Austrians were over-represented in the Nazi machinery of terror: key perpetrators like Adolf Eichmann (architect of the Holocaust) and Ernst Kaltenbrunner (Gestapo chief) were Austrian, as were many concentration camp personnel. Austrian anti-Semitism ran deep before Hitler (Karl Lueger , Vienna's mayor around 1900, was famously anti-Semitic). Pelinka notes that in the 1930s even the native Austrian right (the Dollfuss/ Schuschnigg regime) had authoritarian and anti-Semitic tendencies, which created fertile ground for Nazi ideology . Austrian Catholics in the 1930s often saw Jews and socialists as common enemies, sometimes competing with Nazis in anti-Semitic rhetoric. Thus, the 'darker side' refers to Austria's failure,   until   the   late   20th   century,   to   fully   acknowledge   these   uncomfortable   truths.   After   1945, denazification in Austria was relatively mild. By 1948, most ex-Nazis (over 90% of whom had their voting rights initially   suspended)  were  amnestied and re-enfranchised .

During the campaign, revelations emerged that he had lied about his wartime service - he was an intelligence officer in a German Army unit implicated in war crimes in the Balkans, not merely a student as his memoir claimed. International outcry (led by the World Jewish Congress) ensued, with Waldheim getting shunned diplomatically after winning the election. The Waldheim scandal was a catharsis : it forced Austrians to discuss their Nazi past openly. It exposed latent anti-Semitism - some Austrians reacted by adopting a siege mentality, claiming foreign (Jewish) groups were smearing Austria. For example, FPÖ leader Jörg Haider and some media insinuated a 'campaign' against Austria, and statements like those from a Waldheim supporter blaming Jews for new anti-Semitism surfaced . Pelinka notes the Waldheim affair 'sharpened both international and domestic perspectives' on Austria's Nazi legacy . Austrians could no longer collectively pretend they had all been victims. The affair's most important outcome was the 'internationalization of Austrian anti-Semitism' - the world began scrutinizing Austria's far-right tendencies.

International scrutiny (Waldheim) and internal political shifts (Haider's rise) forced a reckoning. On the positive side, Austria did start coming to terms: official acknowledgment of co-responsibility for Nazi crimes, and educational efforts improved. On the worrisome side, the persistence (or revival) of far-right populism showed that some attitudes never fully disappeared - they merely changed form.

The 1990s grand coalition (SPÖ/ÖVP) often lacked a clear reform drive, leading to what some termed 'standstill' or small crises of governability (frequent squabbles, short-lived governments in 1994-95). Yet Austria navigated major transitions relatively well: the EU accession was achieved smoothly by 1995 with strong public mandate ; the economy adjusted to EU competition with only mild turbulence; and institutions like the parliament became more lively as the dominance of two parties declined (which Pelinka sees as a healthy democratization). He does hint that the grand coalition of the 90s governed more from necessity (to exclude the FPÖ) than vision - lacking 'alternatives,' they stuck together and declared most of the postwar goals accomplished (democracy stable, nation built). However , this very success meant the old grand-coalition format had outlived its purpose, and any further 'deconcentration' of politics (i.e., erosion of SPÖ/ÖVP duopoly) could open the door to new governing constellations. Indeed, Pelinka foresaw that the grand coalition might not hold forever - which was prescient, as in 2000 an ÖVP-FPÖ government formed, breaking the postwar mold. In terms of integration, Austria in the future would be ever more entwined with the EU. The author implies Austria must find its place in a possibly federating Europe - figuring out how to balance its sovereignty and identity with being a good EU member. For example, adopting the euro, participating in EU policymaking, and perhaps joining EU defense structures were on the horizon. These integrative steps require public support, so managing them without causing identity crises is a key task (hence emphasizing Westernization as a comfortable framing). · 92"

One aspect is that Austrian national identity has solidified : by the 1990s virtually all Austrians (even those voting for pan-Germanic FPÖ) accept that Austria is a distinct nation .   The old debate 'Are we Germans or Austrians?' is settled in favor of Austrian nationhood. However, an evolving identity issue will be Austria's role as a multicultural society .   Historically,   except   for   regional   minorities,   Austria   was homogeneous; by the 2000s, with 10-12% foreign-born and their descendants, Austria will have to integrate immigrants into its national narrative. This includes second-generation Turks, Balkan refugees who stayed, etc. A 'different Austria' will be one that possibly embraces a more multiethnic identity, 23"

Pelinka likely means Austria can leverage that by acting as a bridge or mediator in the EU for new Eastern members (which indeed Austria did after 2004 when many ex-communist countries joined EU). Culturally, Austrians have come to see themselves as part of the wider European mainstream rather than an isolated alpine republic. The population's overwhelming support for EU membership in 1994 and again in the Euro introduction reflected this acceptance. ·"

      "text": "Political Culture Changes: A future Austria would probably be more open to political alternation and not fear instability as much as earlier generations did. The high voter volatility in the 1990s (with many late-deciding or swing voters) suggests Austrians became comfortable 'throwing the rascals out' if needed - a normal democratic impulse, contrasting with the deferential stability of earlier decades. Also, civil society has grown stronger: NGOs, citizen initiatives, and referenda started playing roles (e.g. various petition drives on EU, environment, etc., some listed in find results). This means a different Austria where politics is not just in party headquarters but also in grassroots movements. · 57"

      "text": "Continuity: Despite all changes, Pelinka likely concludes that some continuities will remain: Austrians' preference for consensus and moderation runs deep. Even as politics becomes more contentious, Austrians generally avoid extremes (Haider's FPÖ, while extreme in rhetoric, still operated   within   democracy).   The   fundamental   success   of   the   Second   Republic   -   stable democracy and prosperity - sets a baseline that any future 'Third Republic' would want to preserve. Austria's future thus is about adapting those successful foundations to new conditions. ·"

      "text": "In closing, Pelinka's study notes that Austria, after emerging from 'the shadow of the past,' is now asserting itself as a modern European democracy ,   no   longer defined by its traumatic history or postwar exceptions. The exam-preparation takeaway is that Austria's political system and identity underwent profound transformations from 1945 to the 1990s: from instability to stability, from isolation to integration, from homogeneity to diversity, and from consensus governance to a more open contest. Austria's challenges ahead include managing right-populism, integrating into the EU fully (potentially even NATO one day), and integrating its own diverse society - but none of these are unique to Austria. They are the normal challenges of Western democracies. In effect, Austria has 'Westernized' to where its future will be decided by the same forces and debates that shape any other Western democracy. This, in itself, is a testament to Austria's postwar journey out of a troubled past into a confident present. The 'different Austria' of the future will be one that still cherishes aspects of its distinct heritage (like cultural traditions, neutrality ethos, social partnership values) but operates firmly within the common European democratic framework."
